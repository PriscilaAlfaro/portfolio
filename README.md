#Week 8-Technigo bootcamp

This is not the most advanced project from a technical standpoint (no javascript involved) but is always one of the hardest projects to finish â€“ because your portfolio will never be finished. The most challenging part of this project is to make sure it works in all the most commonly used web browsers but also for people that experience disabilities.

Test for accesibility in `https://wave.webaim.org/` and `https://tenon.io/`
Cross browser testing in safari, mozilla, opera, chrome.
